SCHOLAR ASSISTANT - EASY APK GUIDE

To generate your APK without any manual work:

1. Open VS Code Terminal.
2. Run this command:
   npm run build-apk

3. WHERE IS MY APK?
   After the command finishes, go to this folder:
   [YourProject] > android > app > build > outputs > apk > debug > app-debug.apk

4. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If you get "gradlew not found": Make sure you have the Android SDK installed on your PC.
   - If you get "JAVA_HOME not set": You need to install Java (JDK 17 or 21).
   - If the build is slow: This is normal for the first time as it downloads the Android engine.

This is the most professional way to get a high-quality app with working Google Ads.
